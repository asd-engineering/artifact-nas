# Asustor — `ipblock` (ADM Defender) tuning for CI

Asustor's ADM has a built-in "Defender" / `ipblock` mechanism that
auto-bans IPs after failed auth attempts. The defaults are aggressive
enough to break CI use cases out of the box:

```
# /usr/builtin/etc/ipblock/ipblock.conf
[Policy]
Enable = Yes
Login_Attempt = 1     ← BAN after a single failed login
Time_Period = 0       ← no time window (instant trigger)
Block_Time = 0        ← ban forever (manual clear only)
Service = 892         ← bitmask: SSH/SFTP/AFP/SMB/etc.
```

Even a single mis-authed `rclone` connection from a runner → IP banned →
every subsequent connection from that IP gets reset during SSH key-
exchange. From the rclone client side, that surfaces as
`NewFs: couldn't initialise SFTP: ... unexpected EOF` (the same error
the `artifact-nas` action's v1.2.0 retry wrapper exists to absorb).

The retry wrapper handles transient noise. It does NOT outlast a
permanent ban. The proper fix is on the NAS.

## File layout

```
/usr/builtin/etc/ipblock/
├── ipblock.conf              ← global policy (above)
├── defender.conf             ← Defender_Type (mode selector)
├── defender.safe             ← WHITELIST: IPs never banned
├── abuseip.conf              ← AbuseIPDB integration config
├── abuseip.safe              ← AbuseIPDB whitelist (auto-managed)
├── abuseip.deny              ← AbuseIPDB-sourced bans
├── abuseipdb_record.csv      ← audit log of submissions
└── ipblock.conntrack         ← runtime state
```

The file we care about: **`defender.safe`** (the manual whitelist).

## `defender.safe` format

Each line is `<ip>;<netmask>;<flag>`. Example:

```
89.131.229.164;0.0.0.0;0
192.168.2.99;0.0.0.0;0
```

- `<ip>` — IPv4 dotted-quad
- `<netmask>` — `0.0.0.0` for single host. CIDR support via netmask is
  appliance-version-dependent — test on your unit. The included script
  emits `0.0.0.0` per IP (safest, always works).
- `<flag>` — observed value is always `0` in the wild; semantics
  undocumented by Asustor.

## Three fix options (combine as needed)

### Option A — Whitelist runner IPs (recommended for CI)

Run `whitelist-cicd.sh --apply` (locally on the NAS) or pipe it via SSH
from a workstation that already has a non-banned login. It fetches
GitHub Actions IP ranges (live, via `api.github.com/meta`), the
documented GitLab.com runner ranges, and any custom IPs you provide,
then expands them to individual `<ip>;0.0.0.0;0` lines and appends to
`defender.safe` (idempotent — won't duplicate existing entries).

```bash
# Preview without writing
./whitelist-cicd.sh --include github,gitlab --custom 192.168.2.0/24 --dry-run

# Apply (writes /usr/builtin/etc/ipblock/defender.safe; requires sudo)
sudo ./whitelist-cicd.sh --include github,gitlab --custom 192.168.2.0/24 --apply
```

### Option B — Loosen the policy

Edit `/usr/builtin/etc/ipblock/ipblock.conf` (or use the ADM web UI →
*System Settings → ADM Defender*):

```ini
[Policy]
Login_Attempt = 10      # allow ~10 failed attempts
Time_Period = 300       # within a 5-minute window
Block_Time = 600        # then ban for 10 minutes (auto-expires)
```

`Block_Time = 600` is the critical change — combined with
`artifact-nas`'s 57s retry budget × multiple jobs, transient bans
clear inside the CI run.

### Option C — Disable for SSH/SFTP only

`Service = 892` is a bitmask. Clearing the SSH bit removes the
ban-policy for SSH/SFTP while keeping it for AFP, SMB, etc. Bit values
are version-dependent — easier to set via ADM web UI checkboxes than
to decode the integer.

## After editing config files

The `ipblock` daemon may need a reload:

```bash
sudo killall -HUP ipblockd 2>/dev/null || sudo /etc/init.d/ipblockd restart 2>/dev/null || \
  sudo /usr/builtin/etc.init.d/ipblockd restart 2>/dev/null || echo "manually restart via ADM web UI"
```

The exact init script name varies; some ADM versions handle config
changes via inotify and don't need a restart.

## Confirming whitelist took effect

After applying the whitelist:

1. Pick a previously-banned IP (or simulate by failing-auth once):
   `ssh -p 2324 invalid@<nas>` once → wait the ban window
2. Re-attempt from the whitelisted IP — should connect cleanly without
   `kex_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer`.
3. Check `/usr/builtin/etc/ipblock/abuseip.deny` (the deny list) to see
   it does NOT contain your runner's IP.
